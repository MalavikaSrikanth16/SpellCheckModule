# SpellCheckModule
It is a Spell Checker written in python.
Running SpellCheck.py checks for every wrongly spelt word in a specified file and appends (CHECK) at the end of the wrongly spelt words.
Upon correcting the spelling mistakes, run Replace.py to remove (CHECK) to get a file free from spelling mistakes.
